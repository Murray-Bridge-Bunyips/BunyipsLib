## BunyipsLib

This is a library of useful functions and classes for use with the FIRST Tech Challenge SDK we use
in competition.<br><br>
Serving as a wrapper over the FIRST SDK, BunyipsLib offers efficient common modules and OpMode
abstractions with error handling,
dynamic device initialisation, native RoadRunner and Vision processing, and an extremely expansible
ecosystem. This library was created to collect standard code between
our teams, including certain robot configurations and components used in multiple of the Bunyips
teams' robots. <br><br>
See the [examples](./src/main/java/org/murraybridgebunyips/bunyipslib/example) for getting
familiar with BunyipsLib.

###### BunyipsLib is maintained by the Murray Bridge High School Student Robotics Club, members Lucas Bubner and Lachlan Paul, 2022-2024.
