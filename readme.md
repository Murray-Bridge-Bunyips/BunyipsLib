BunyipsLib was originally a collection of common functions that our FTC teams used in competition.
It has since evolved into a full-fledged library that is used by all of our teams. It is designed to
provide useful development utilities in making robot code, offering efficient common modules and OpMode abstractions with
error handling, dynamic device initialisation, native RoadRunner, FtcDashboard, and Vision processing, and an
extremely expansible ecosystem.

BunyipsLib takes inspiration from FTCLib, RoadRunner, and other libraries, and is designed to be
the one-stop shop for all of our teams' needs. It is designed to be easy to use, and to integrate
the latest and greatest features from the FTC SDK and other libraries.
