/**
 * A task, or command is an action that can be performed by a robot. This has been designed
 * to reflect closely the command-based programming style used in FRC, while still being
 * reflective of the past nature of how the Task system was implemented in BunyipsLib.
 *
 * The task system in BunyipsLib has been constructed from the ground-up with a more self-sufficient
 * where Tasks are at their core stripped into running some code for some time, somewhere, where all conditions for
 * state are handled internally and not by an external scheduler. The original behaviour of tasks running
 * outright used to be the legacy roots of how Tasks worked, and since has adopted some command-based structures that work
 * by running them in the contexts of other subsystems.
 *
 * As of 6.0.0, the Task system now implements the [Action] interface for seamless compatibility with RoadRunner v1.0.0.
 * The [ActionTask] may be used to convert a pure [Action] into a task, however, writing a task directly using a
 * Task is encouraged for more control and flexibility, due to there being no downsides to doing so and the exposure
 * of the same accessors. Additional changes have also been made to allow for simpler construction of tasks, and
 * the introduction of a new [DynamicTask] class to allow for more flexible task construction.
 *
