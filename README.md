##### A powerful all-in-one framework library for FTC used by the Murray Bridge High School Student Robotics Club.

BunyipsLib was originally a collection of common functions that our FTC teams used in competition.
It has since evolved into a full-fledged library that is used by all of our teams. It is designed to
provide useful development utilities in making robot code, offering efficient common modules and
OpMode abstractions with
error handling, dynamic device initialisation, native RoadRunner v1.0 and MeepMeep support, FtcDashboard, Vision
processing, subsystems and tasks, and an expansible ecosystem focused on multi-bot repos and developer experience.

BunyipsLib takes inspiration from FTCLib, WPILib, RoadRunner, and other libraries, and is designed
to be the one-stop shop for all of our teams' needs. It is designed to be easy to use, and to integrate
the latest and greatest features from the FTC SDK and other libraries.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> BunyipsLib is in active and continually experimental development, expect bugs and to keep up to
> date!

BunyipsLib is a developer-focused framework, directed at components that are well-documented and able to be
used as learning resources.
Reusability between robots is an essential design element of BunyipsLib, to get ideas implemented faster and to write
clean and simple code.

> [!TIP]
> Consult our [wiki](https://github.com/Murray-Bridge-Bunyips/BunyipsLib/wiki/) for information, installation
> instructions, and to see more of the features that BunyipsLib offers.

We use BunyipsLib ourselves in both Kotlin and Java for our own
robots, see [BunyipsFTC](https://github.com/Murray-Bridge-Bunyips/BunyipsFTC/) for more examples.
